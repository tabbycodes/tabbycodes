Hi, I’m <b><i>Tabata Viso-Naffah</b></i> (<i>@tabbycodes</i>). I'm a mechanical engineer interested in robotics and autonomous systems, perception engineering, full stack software development, machine learning, human-robotic interaction, and the ethics of artificial intelligence. 
I’m currently self-learning ROS, Python, C++, and SQL, and would love to collaborate on projects related to my interests.
